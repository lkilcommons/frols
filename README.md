Forward Regression Orthogonal Least Squares

Notes and a start at implementing the FROLS algorithm, following 
Billings S.A. "Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains". Wiley, 2013
(e.g. pp. 63)

Fair warning, I have not checked extensively to see if this implementation is correct. In the notebook, I test the algorithm on an example from the book, and it produces a reasonably close result, but not exact.
